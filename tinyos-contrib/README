This contrib directory contains a port of the Raven platform originally written
by Martin Cerveny. The original sources were taken from the tinyos-2.x-contrib
repository at https://github.com/tyll/tinyos-2.x-contrib/blob/master/mc/raven.

This port contains support for the Atmega1284p, which is used in the hardware
used for the TinyMoose experiment.

To add this contrib to the main TinyOS repository, simply copy the files using
the following command from the root of the repository:

  $ cp -rv tinyos-contrib/ tinyos-main/
